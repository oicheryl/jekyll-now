Our March 2020 Cloud Native London meetup kicked off with more details of the Kubernetes Community Days London 2020, then we had three great speakers: Richard Simon from World Wide Technology, Pradeep Bhadani from Cloud Native Technologies, and Naadir Jeewa from VMWare. Check out their takeaways below. The video recording will be added shortly.

First up, Richard Simon from World Wide Technology told us about the Cloud State Of Play. His takeaways are that:

* Organisations that have moved or are considering moving workloads to the cloud, need to conduct a Cloud Readiness Assessment, to understand their position and ability to deliver successful migrations.
* Organisations that are looking to migrate or have migrated will benefit from a Cloud Performance and Hosting Candidacy, to optimise their cloud footprint, as well as identifying the low-hanging fruit workloads.
* Selecting a partner that is impartial and will take an organisation's requirements from idea to outcome - not just offer recommendations - is a key differentiator, when selecting a cloud partner for your journey.

Next up, Pradeep Bhadani from Cloud Native Technologies talked about how to Build and Test GCP Infrastructure using Terraform Modules. He concluded that:

* Terraform is an open source, very powerful tool to implement Infrastructure as Code.
* Terraform modules can really help to build infrastructure in quickly and in repeatable fashion.
* Testing frameworks like Kitchen-terraform, Inspec-gcp helps when developing Terraform modules which are intended to be shared with larger teams.

Finally,  Naadir Jeewa from VMWare closed out our evening by describing “Declarative cluster management using Kubernetes all the way down” - The why and how of Kubernetes Cluster API. He summed it up with these takeaways:

* Cluster API aims to be the canonical way to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters across any type of infrastructure using Kubernetes itself, enabling self-service multi-cluster management
* When writing controllers to manage other distributed systems, making sure your controllers are idempotent and reentrant is key to correctness
* Kubebuilder and controller-runtime are the best ways to write reliable Kubernetes controllers today

## Cloud Native London April
