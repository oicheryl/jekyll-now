Cloud Native London was back for our June virtual meetup on Zoom and YouTube to hear from EXELERYS, DataStax and CloudSkiff.

We are, as always, immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/), and [Intel](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/homepage.html), for your support and sponsorship.

### Overview

We had a interesting evening of talks, kicking off with Jesus Escolar from EXELERYS giving us An Advanced View of Container Security (starting at [21:41](https://youtu.be/yX2GoXB70iA?t=1301)). His takeaways will be added shortly.


Next up was Cedrick Lunven from DataStax who told us about Deploying Apache Cassandra on Kubernetes with Cass Operator (starting at [51:50](https://youtu.be/yX2GoXB70iA?t=3110)). His takeaways can be found at:

* [Build a DevOps Pipeline with Kubernetes and Apache Cassandraâ„¢! - Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q2-NsZJ7Q)
* [Astra: The Future of Apache Cassandra is Cloud Native - blog post](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2020/05/why-astra-good-cassandra)

He also linked to the following resources:

* [Kubernetes workshop materials](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubernetes-workshop-online)
* [Register for the workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-build-a-devops-pipeline-with-kubernetes-and-apache-cassandratm-tickets-106944768682?aff=erelexpmlt)
* [Get the free Cassandra book](https://www.datastax.com/resources/ebook/oreilly-cassandra-definitive-guide)
* [Side-car for Cassandra](https://github.com/datastax/management-api-for-apache-cassandra)

His slides can be found [here](/resources/Cedrick_Datastax_DeployingCasssandrak8s.pdf)

Finally (following a fantastic bit of unplanned musical entertainment from Khusro Jaleel in the break), we had Stephane Jourdan from CloudSkiff discussing the Key Steps to a Good Quality For Your Infrastructure Code (starting at [1:45:52](https://youtu.be/yX2GoXB70iA?t=6352)). His takeaways are:

* Infrastructure as Code is code. Make sure you apply best practices to ensure good quality.
* Build solid workflows, manage roles and permissions.
* Have a clear understanding of the boundaries of testing in Infrastructure as Code. Static analysis (security, quality and best practices), unit and integration tests are the code of it.
