The July Cloud Native London virtual meetup was back on Zoom and YouTube, on what turned out to be our third anniversary! We welcomed speakers from Dynatrace, Contino, and Microsoft.

We are immensely grateful to [Tecknuovo](https://www.tecknuovo.com/), [Humio](https://humio.com/), [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/), [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) and [Intel](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/homepage.html), for your ongoing support and sponsorship.

### Overview

Kicking off three great talks was Josh Armitage from Contino, with Serverless vs Kubernetes - The Great Cloud Native Debate. He mentioned in his takeaways:

* When working on greenfield systems, optimise for a tight Build -> Measure -> Learn loop, aka lean startup methodologies, over engineering for potential scale
* Activities fall into 3 buckets, value generating, necessary waste and unnecessary waste, by bucketing what we do we can maximimise, minimise and eliminate as appropriate
* Going serverless first is a good rule of thumb, especially for web apps, if you have strict technical or regulatory requirements you may need to look at Kubernetes

Next up was Juergen Etzlstorfer from Dynatrace who told us about Overcoming scalability issues in your Prometheus ecosystem. His takeaways are:

* Overcome the challenge of complex onboarding and ad-hoc configuration of applications by applying a GitOps approach to stay in control.
* Use code generators instead of manually creating configuration files and dashboards. Significantly reduce the time you spend and errors you make when writing configuration files.
* Instead of building your own solution, use a cloud-native framework helping you get the job done â€“ for example Keptn.

Finally, after a 15 minute break we had Alicja Kucharczyk from Microsoft discussing Architecting petabyte-scale analytics by scaling out Postgres on Azure with Citus. Her takeaways explained that:

* Citus makes it simple to add nodes and scale out compute, memory, and disk. So you no longer have to worry about how to scale and grow with PostgreSQL.
* By parallelizing SQL across multiple nodes, Citus delivers insanely fast performance. Even with real-time data ingest & billions of rows of data.
* In the cloud, Citus is built into Azure Database for PostgreSQL, a managed database as a service.

In reference to our usual group photo at our in person meetups, I made sure to take a quick photo before we closed for the night.
